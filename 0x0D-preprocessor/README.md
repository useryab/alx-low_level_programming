## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

* What are macros and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined macros
* How to include guard your header files

## Tasks

### 0. Object-like Macro

Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

### 1. Pi

Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

### 2. File name

Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

### 3. Function-like macro

Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

### 4. SUM

Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
