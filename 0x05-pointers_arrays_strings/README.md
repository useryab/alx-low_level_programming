# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives :white_check_mark:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

## Tasks 

### 0. 98 Battery st.

Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream

Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read

Write a function that returns the length of a string.

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear

Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes

Write a function that reverses a string.

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true

Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half

Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

### 8. Arrays are not pointers

Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### 9. strcpy

Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

* Return value: the pointer to dest

### 10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers

Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

### 11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code

Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x04.c)
