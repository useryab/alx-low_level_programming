## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is malloc and free and how to use them
* Why and when use malloc
* How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

## Tasks

### 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

### 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings

Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

### 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

### 3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize

Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

### 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up

Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

### 5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe

Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

### 6. I will show you how great I am

Write a function that splits a string into words.
