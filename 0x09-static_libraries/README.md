# 0x09. C - Static libraries

In C programming, a static library is a collection of compiled object files (.o) that are linked into the executable file during the linking phase of compilation. Unlike dynamic libraries, static libraries are not loaded into memory at runtime; instead, the code from the static library is incorporated directly into the executable file. This makes static libraries more self-contained and less dependent on external dependencies.

## Benefits of static libraries:

* Self-contained: Static libraries don't require the presence of any external shared libraries at runtime, making them more portable and less prone to runtime errors caused by missing or incompatible library versions.

* Faster startup time: Since the code from the static library is already embedded in the executable, there's no need to load it from disk at runtime, leading to faster startup times.

* Smaller memory footprint: Static libraries can reduce the overall memory footprint of the application, as the code is not shared among multiple processes.

## Drawbacks of static libraries:

* Increased executable size: Incorporating the code from the static library into the executable can increase the size of the executable file, which can be a concern for applications that need to be small and lightweight.

* Dependency management: Changes made to the static library require recompilation of all applications that rely on it, making it more difficult to manage dependencies and update libraries across multiple projects.

## When to use static libraries:

Static libraries are well-suited for situations where:

* Portability is crucial: Static libraries are less prone to runtime errors caused by missing or incompatible shared libraries, making them more suitable for cross-platform development and environments with limited control over the system's library configuration.

* Startup time is critical: Static libraries can reduce startup time by eliminating the need to load shared libraries at runtime.

* Memory usage is a concern: Static libraries can reduce overall memory consumption by not sharing code among multiple processes.

## When to use dynamic libraries:

Dynamic libraries are better suited for situations where:

* Frequently updated libraries: Dynamic libraries allow for easier updating of shared code without recompiling all dependent applications.

* Reducing executable size: Dynamic libraries can reduce the size of executables by sharing code among multiple processes.

* Efficient memory usage: Dynamic libraries allow for more efficient memory usage by sharing code among multiple processes.

In summary, static libraries and dynamic libraries each have their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of which type of library to use depends on the specific requirements of the application.
